# SCN - A Micro Social Network for Choir

This project is aimed at creating a website containing useful tools for organizing a small group of people gathering
around music.

I started it specifically for a newly formed choir in which I sing, which could benefit from its own digital space to
facilitate cohesion and group effect.

## Goals:

### Transparency and Information Aggregation

In an amateur group, practical information is often transmitted by email and can get lost over time or in a massive flow
of responses. The idea is to gather these organizational details in one easy-to-access place.

### Encouragement and Facilitation of Musical Work

During rehearsals, there is often a more experienced person who leads the direction. However, at home, everyone is left
with his/her own musical abilities.
The goal is to find ways to make this preparation less daunting. For this, there is the provision
of content (scores, audios, lyrics, translations); but also the development (ongoing) of a player that helps in
rehearsing certain segments, listening selectively to parallel voices...

### Access for All

The aim of the site is to be easy to access and use, and to limit the barriers related to digital divide.
Furthermore, the CMS form allows anyone without development skills to take part in content management.
These two factors combined promote a truly democratic management of this social space.

### Group Archives

A group lives, creates memories, decisions. These are generally lost in emails, in the form of links that can expire.
The idea here is to gather contents and make them available.

## Development Phases:

February 2024: MVP with page for displaying group events and musical contents (scores, audios, lyrics)

April 2024 (ongoing): genericization of the site, possible customization by the user.

* Theme customization (color, templates)
* Menu customization
* Display customization in calendar pages
* Responsiveness improvement
* ...

Summer 2024:

* Addition of interaction features (polls, comments, wiki)
* Addition of advanced features for the audio player
* Addition of a photo/document gallery with the group's memories

## Demo

There is a demo site used to showcase ongoing developments and obtain feedback from users.
